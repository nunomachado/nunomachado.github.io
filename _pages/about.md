I am a Data Engineer at [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com), based in Madrid, working on flagship projects that combine distributed systems and machine learning to deliver real-time intelligent answers to customers.

Before moving to the industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab)](https://haslab.uminho.pt) of INESC TEC and University of Minho, conducting research on different aspects of distributed systems, namely monitoring, debugging, and large-scale storage.

I received a Ph.D. from [Instituto Superior Técnico (University of Lisbon)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) in 2016. My Ph.D. work was focused on automated tools to discover, replay, and isolate bugs in multithreaded programs. During this time, I was also an intern at Microsoft Research (Redmond) and a visiting research scholar at Carnegie Mellon University’s [Abstract Group](http://abstract.ece.cmu.edu).
